# Node Projects

I have here two projects that I have developed with the purpose of practicing/learning Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB.

###Project 1: Twitter Stream
This app is a simple twitter word-tracker. The form will inquire the user which word they want to track, and the app will then provide a live stream of tweets containing that word.

###Project 2: Guestlist Express
This app allows for users to quickly store, update, delete and view guests within a guestlist. Again, pretty basic but fun to implement and great way to practice CRUD roots.


###Setup
Download the zip files, open console, go to either app sub-directory, install node https://nodejs.org/, install mongoDB https://www.mongodb.org/, initiate MongoDB, then type npm start, and you're ready to go on http://localhost:3000!
If that's too much work, you can always check the source-code :-)

###Technologies used:
* Node.js
* Jade
* Morgan
* Express.js
* Mongo.db
* Nodemon
* Twit API
